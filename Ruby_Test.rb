 #  answer method. In addition, each is followed by a method to copy the question and answer from quiz taker to a .txt file that is dated 
 #  at the end. Date will follow YYYY-MM-DD Time HH:MM:SS in 24 hour format. Should you need to add: Below is your standard block.

 #  gets <-- allows to get the answer .chomp <--- prevents a line break after as is standard to line break .to_i <--- changes answer 
 #  to integer in Ruby. If we don't do that the program will not accept the numbers inserted as an answer. answer <---- this says that

 #  The else means if it is anyting else it will count as incorrect and wil add one to the incorrect file. Change these as needed for 
 #  question. The beginning if answer.between?(1, 4) Checks to see the answer is between 1 and 4 if so that section breaks and proceeds

 #    it means the actions are to be performed on that file. The puts after tells it to put the question in file followed by user answer 
 #    and result the final bit separates each question with 40 - puts This creates a space between questions. The puts command purpose is 
 #    to put what follows on screen but without anything to put on screen it creates a line break. If we wish to show anything that isn't
