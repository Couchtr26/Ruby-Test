## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Run the quiz with:
   ```bash
   ruby test.rb

2. Answer each question by typing the number(s) and pressing Enter.

   For multi-select questions, separate answers with commas (e.g. 2,3)

3. Your answers and results will be saved to review_log.txt.

4. To review past attempts:
   
   ruby test.rb
   
   and select the review option.
ðŸ§ª Minitest
To run the included tests:

ruby minitest_program.rb

This validates core logic and ensures the quiz engine behaves as expected.
